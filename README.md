# Class-D-Audio-Amplifier-2x50W

High-quality stereo class D audio amplifier (2x50W). The board is based on Texas Instruments TPA3118D2 (Class D amplifier IC). Adding a heatsink to the IC is necessary to fully utilize this board's power capabilities. All parts I used are listed in BOM and part numbers for Mouser Electronics are provided. Values of filter capacitors can be changed to optimize t for subwoofer operation. If you want to do this please refer to the datasheet of the IC and application circuit provided.
